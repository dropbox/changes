Changes
-------

Changes is a build coordinator and reporting solution written in Python.

The project is primarily built on top of Jenkins, but efforts are underway to
replace the underlying dependency. The current work-in-progress tooling exists
under several additional repositories:

- https://github.com/dropbox/changes-client
- https://github.com/dropbox/changes-mesos-framework

.. note:: **Changes is under extremely active and rapid development, and you probably shouldn't use it unless you like broken software.**

Getting Started
===============

While still fairly rough, you'll want to refer to our `documentation <http://changes-dropbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
